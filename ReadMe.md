# GEOTRACESTools.jl

A package for reading and using GEOTRACES data in Julia.

In order to use this software, you must first download the GEOTRACES IDP 17 data as nc files.

For the discrete sample data, make sure it is located in a `Data` directory in your "home" directory. That is it should be there:
```
$HOME/Data/GEOTRACES/GEOTRACES_IDP2017_v2 2/discrete_sample_data/netcdf/GEOTRACES_IDP2017_v2_Discrete_Sample_Data.nc
```

Downloading the data manually is unfortunately mandatory at this stage.
